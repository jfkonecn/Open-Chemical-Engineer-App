# OpenChE
Multi-Platform Open Source Chemical Engineering App

OpenChE is an app which is intended to be a calculator which contains all routine Chemical Engineering calculations. 
The goal is to make a convenient way to perform quick, but not official, calculations when a pencil and paper is not close by.

Functions primarily used by other engineering disciplines are welcome to be included as well.
